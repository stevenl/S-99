Logic and Codes
---------------

As in the previous section, we will start with a skeleton file, `logic1.scala`, and add code to it for each problem. The difference here is that the file starts out almost empty.

#### P46 (**) Truth tables for logical expressions.

Define functions `and`, `or`, `nand`, `nor`, `xor`, `impl`, and `equ` (for logical equivalence) which return true or false according to the result of their respective operations; e.g. `and(A, B)` is true if and only if both _A_ and _B_ are true.

    scala> and(true, true)
    res0: Boolean = true

    scala> xor(true. true)
    res1: Boolean = false

A logical expression in two variables can then be written as an function of two variables, e.g: `(a: Boolean, b: Boolean) => and(or(a, b), nand(a, b))`

Now, write a function called `table2` which prints the truth table of a given logical expression in two variables.

    scala> table2((a: Boolean, b: Boolean) => and(a, or(a, b)))
    A     B     result
    true  true  true
    true  false true
    false true  false
    false false false

#### P47 (*) Truth tables for logical expressions (2).
Continue problem P46 by redefining and, or, etc as operators. (i.e. make them methods of a new class with an implicit conversion from Boolean.) not will have to be left as a object method.

    scala> table2((a: Boolean, b: Boolean) => a and (a or not(b)))
    A     B     result
    true  true  true
    true  false true
    false true  false
    false false false

#### P48 (**) Truth tables for logical expressions (3).

Omitted for now.

#### P49 (**) Gray code.

An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed according to certain rules. For example,

    n = 1: C(1) = ("0", "1").
    n = 2: C(2) = ("00", "01", "11", "10").
    n = 3: C(3) = ("000", "001", "011", "010", "110", "111", "101", "100").

Find out the construction rules and write a function to generate Gray codes.

    scala> gray(3)
    res0 List[String] = List(000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100)

See if you can use memoization to make the function more efficient.

#### P50 (***) Huffman code.

First of all, consult a good book on discrete mathematics or algorithms for a detailed description of Huffman codes!

We suppose a set of symbols with their frequencies, given as a list of `(S, F)` Tuples. E.g. `(("a", 45), ("b", 13), ("c", 12), ("d", 16), ("e", 9), ("f", 5))`. Our objective is to construct a list of `(S, C)` Tuples, where _C_ is the Huffman code word for the symbol _S_.

    scala> huffman(List(("a", 45), ("b", 13), ("c", 12), ("d", 16), ("e", 9), ("f", 5)))
    res0: List[String, String] = List((a,0), (b,101), (c,100), (d,111), (e,1101), (f,1100))
