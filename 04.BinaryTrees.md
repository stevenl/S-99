Binary Trees
------------

A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root element and two successors, which are binary trees themselves.

We shall use the following classes to represent binary trees. (Also available in `tree1.scala`.) An *End* is equivalent to an empty tree. A *Branch* has a value, and two descendant trees. The `toString` functions are relatively arbitrary, but they yield a more compact output than Scala's default. Putting a plus in front of the `T` makes the class *covariant*; it will be able to hold subtypes of whatever type it's created for. (This is important so that `End` can be a singleton object; as a singleton, it must have a specific type, so we give it type `Nothing`, which is a subtype of every other type.)

    sealed abstract class Tree[+T]
    case class Node[+T](value: T, left: Tree[T], right: Tree[T]) extends Tree[T] {
      override def toString = "T(" + value.toString + " " + left.toString + " " + right.toString + ")"
    }
    case object End extends Tree[Nothing] {
      override def toString = "."
    }
    object Node {
      def apply[T](value: T): Node[T] = Node(value, End, End)
    }

The example tree on the right is given by

    Node('a',
         Node('b', Node('d'), Node('e')),
         Node('c', End, Node('f', Node('g'), End)))

A tree with only a root node would be Node('a') and an empty tree would be End.

Throughout this section, we will be adding methods to the classes above, mostly to Tree.

#### P54 Omitted; our tree representation will only allow well-formed trees.

Score one for static typing.

#### P55 (**) Construct completely balanced binary trees.

In a completely balanced binary tree, the following property holds for every node: The number of nodes in its left subtree and the number of nodes in its right subtree are almost equal, which means their difference is not greater than one.

Define an object named `Tree`. Write a function `Tree.cBalanced` to construct completely balanced binary trees for a given number of nodes. The function should generate all solutions. The function should take as parameters the number of nodes and a single value to put in all of them.

    scala> Tree.cBalanced(4, "x")
    res0: List(Node[String]) = List(T(x T(x . .) T(x . T(x . .))), T(x T(x . .) T(x T(x . .) .)), ...

#### P56 (**) Symmetric binary trees.

Let us call a binary tree symmetric if you can draw a vertical line through the root node and then the right subtree is the mirror image of the left subtree. Add an `isSymmetric` method to the `Tree` class to check whether a given binary tree is symmetric. Hint: Write an `isMirrorOf` method first to check whether one tree is the mirror image of another. We are only interested in the structure, not in the contents of the nodes.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b'), Node('c')).isSymmetric
    res0: Boolean = true

#### P57 (**) Binary search trees (dictionaries).

Write a function to add an element to a binary search tree.

    scala> End.addValue(2)
    res0: Node[Int] = T(2 . .)

    scala> res0.addValue(3)
    res1: Node[Int] = T(2 . T(3 . .))

    scala> res1.addValue(0)
    res2: Node[Int] = T(2 T(0 . .) T(3 . .))

Hint: The abstract definition of `addValue` in `Tree` should be `def addValue[U >: T <% Ordered[U]](x: U): Tree[U]`. The `>: T` is because `addValue`'s parameters need to be *contravariant* in `T`. (Conceptually, we're adding nodes above existing nodes. In order for the subnodes to be of type `T` or any subtype, the upper nodes must be of type `T` or any supertype.) The `<% Ordered[U]` allows us to use the `<` operator on the values in the tree.

Use that function to construct a binary tree from a list of integers.

    scala> Tree.fromList(List(3, 2, 5, 7, 1))
    res3: Node[Int] = T(3 T(2 T(1 . .) .) T(5 . T(7 . .)))

Finally, use that function to test your solution to P56.

    scala> Tree.fromList(List(5, 3, 18, 1, 4, 12, 21)).isSymmetric
    res4: Boolean = true

    scala> Tree.fromList(List(3, 2, 5, 7, 4)).isSymmetric
    res5: Boolean = false

#### P58 (**) Generate-and-test paradigm.

Apply the generate-and-test paradigm to construct all symmetric, completely balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.

    scala> Tree.symmetricBalancedTrees(5, "x")
    res0: List[Node[String]] = List(T(x T(x . T(x . .)) T(x T(x . .) .)), T(x T(x T(x . .) .) T(x . T(x . .))))

#### P59 (**) Construct height-balanced binary trees.

In a height-balanced binary tree, the following property holds for every node: The height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree are almost equal, which means their difference is not greater than one.

Write a method `Tree.hbalTrees` to construct height-balanced binary trees for a given height with a supplied value for the nodes. The function should generate all solutions.

    scala> Tree.hbalTrees(3, "x")
    res0: List[Node[String]] = List(T(x T(x T(x . .) T(x . .)) T(x T(x . .) T(x . .))), T(x T(x T(x . .) T(x . .)) T(x T(x . .) .)), ...

#### P60 (**) Construct height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.

Consider a height-balanced binary tree of height _H_. What is the maximum number of nodes it can contain? Clearly, _MaxN_ = 2^H - 1. However, what is the minimum number _MinN_? This question is more difficult. Try to find a recursive statement and turn it into a function `minHbalNodes` that takes a height and returns _MinN_.

    scala> minHbalNodes(3)
    res0: Int = 4

On the other hand, we might ask: what is the maximum height _H_ a height-balanced binary tree with _N_ nodes can have? Write a `maxHbalHeight` function.

    scala> maxHbalHeight(4)
    res1: Int = 3

Now, we can attack the main problem: construct all the height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.

    scala> Tree.hbalTreesWithNodes(4, "x")
    res2: List[Node[String]] = List(T(x T(x T(x . .) .) T(x . .)), T(x T(x . T(x . .)) T(x . .)), ...

Find out how many height-balanced trees exist for _N_ = 15.

    P61 (*) Count the leaves of a binary tree.

A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a method `leafCount` to count them.

    scala> Node('x', Node('x'), End).leafCount
    res0: Int = 1

#### 61A (*) Collect the leaves of a binary tree in a list.

A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a method `leafList` to collect them in a list.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b'), Node('c', Node('d'), Node('e'))).leafList
    res0: List[Char] = List(b, d, e)

#### P62 (*) Collect the internal nodes of a binary tree in a list.

An internal node of a binary tree has either one or two non-empty successors. Write a method `internalList` to collect them in a list.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b'), Node('c', Node('d'), Node('e'))).internalList
    res0: List[Char] = List(a, c)

#### P62B (*) Collect the nodes at a given level in a list.

A node of a binary tree is at level _N_ if the path from the root to the node has length _N_ - 1. The root node is at level 1. Write a method `atLevel` to collect all nodes at a given level in a list.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b'), Node('c', Node('d'), Node('e'))).atLevel(2)
    res0: List[Char] = List(b, c)

Using `atLevel` it is easy to construct a method `levelOrder` which creates the level-order sequence of the nodes. However, there are more efficient ways to do that.

#### P63 (**) Construct a complete binary tree.

A complete binary tree with height _H_ is defined as follows: The levels _1, 2, 3, ..., H-1_ contain the maximum number of nodes (i.e _2^(i-1)_ at the level _i_, note that we start counting the levels from 1 at the root). In level _H_, which may contain less than the maximum possible number of nodes, all the nodes are "left-adjusted". This means that in a levelorder tree traversal all internal nodes come first, the leaves come second, and empty successors (the Ends which are not really nodes!) come last.

Particularly, complete binary trees are used as data structures (or addressing schemes) for heaps.

We can assign an address number to each node in a complete binary tree by enumerating the nodes in level-order, starting at the root with number 1. In doing so, we realize that for every node _X_ with address _A_ the following property holds: The address of _X_'s left and right successors are 2\*A and 2\*A+1, respectively, supposed the successors do exist. This fact can be used to elegantly construct a complete binary tree structure. Write a method `completeBinaryTree` that takes as parameters the number of nodes and the value to put in each node.

    scala> Tree.completeBinaryTree(6, "x")
    res0: Node[String] = T(x T(x T(x . .) T(x . .)) T(x T(x . .) .))

#### P64 (**) Layout a binary tree (1).

As a preparation for drawing a tree, a layout algorithm is required to determine the position of each node in a rectangular grid. Several layout methods are conceivable, one of them is shown in the illustration on the right.

In this layout strategy, the position of a node v is obtained by the following two rules:

 * _x(v)_ is equal to the position of the node _v_ in the inorder sequence
 * _y(v)_ is equal to the depth of the node _v_ in the tree

In order to store the position of the nodes, we add a new class with the additional information.

    case class PositionedNode[+T](override val value: T, override val left: Tree[T], override val right: Tree[T], x: Int, y: Int) extends Node[T](value, left, right) {
      override def toString = "T[" + x.toString + "," + y.toString + "](" +     value.toString + " " + left.toString + " " + right.toString + ")"
    }

Write a method layoutBinaryTree that turns a tree of normal Nodes into a tree of PositionedNodes.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b', End, Node('c')), Node('d')).layoutBinaryTree
    res0: PositionedNode[Char] = T[3,1](a T[1,2](b . T[2,3](c . .)) T[4,2](d . .))

The tree at right may be constructed with `Tree.fromList(List('n', 'k', 'm', 'c', 'a', 'h', 'g', 'e', 'u', 'p', 's', 'q'))`. Use it to check your code.

#### P65 (**) Layout a binary tree (2).

An alternative layout method is depicted in the illustration opposite. Find out the rules and write the corresponding method. Hint: On a given level, the horizontal distance between neighboring nodes is constant.

Use the same conventions as in problem P64.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b', End, Node('c')), Node('d')).layoutBinaryTree2
    res0: PositionedNode[Char] = T[3,1]('a T[1,2]('b . T[2,3]('c . .)) T[5,2]('d . .))

The tree at right may be constructed with `Tree.fromList(List('n', 'k', 'm', 'c', 'a', 'e', 'd', 'g', 'u', 'p', 'q'))`. Use it to check your code.

#### P66 (***) Layout a binary tree (3).

Yet another layout strategy is shown in the illustration opposite. The method yields a very compact layout while maintaining a certain symmetry in every node. Find out the rules and write the corresponding method. Hint: Consider the horizontal distance between a node and its successor nodes. How tight can you pack together two subtrees to construct the combined binary tree?

Use the same conventions as in problem P64 and P65. Note: This is a difficult problem. Don't give up too early!

    scala> Node('a', Node('b', End, Node('c')), Node('d')).layoutBinaryTree3
    res0: PositionedNode[Char] = T[2,1]('a T[1,2]('b . T[2,3]('c . .)) T[3,2]('d . .))

Which layout do you like most?

#### P67 (**) A string representation of binary trees.

Somebody represents binary trees as strings of the following type (see example opposite):

    a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))

Write a method which generates this string representation, if the tree is given as usual (in `Node`s and `End`s). Use that method for the `Tree` class's and subclass's `toString` methods. Then write a method (on the `Tree` object) which does this inverse; i.e. given the string representation, construct the tree in the usual form.

For simplicity, suppose the information in the nodes is a single letter and there are no spaces in the string.

    scala> Node('a', Node('b', Node('d'), Node('e')), Node('c', End, Node('f', Node('g'), End))).toString
    res0: String = a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))

    scala> Tree.fromString("a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))")
    res1: Node[Char] = a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))

#### P68 (**) Preorder and inorder sequences of binary trees.

We consider binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower-case letters, as in the example of problem P67.

 1. Write methods preorder and inorder that construct the preorder and inorder sequence of a given binary tree, respectively. The results should be lists, e.g. `List('a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'f', 'g')` for the preorder sequence of the example in problem P67.

        scala> Tree.string2Tree("a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))").preorder
        res0: List[Char] = List(a, b, d, e, c, f, g)

        scala> Tree.string2Tree("a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))").inorder
        res1: List[Char] = List(d, b, e, a, c, g, f)

 2. If both the preorder sequence and the inorder sequence of the nodes of a binary tree are given, then the tree is determined unambiguously. Write a method `preInTree` that does the job.

        scala> Tree.preInTree(List('a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'f', 'g'), List('d', 'b', 'e', 'a', 'c', 'g', 'f'))
        res2: Node[Char] = a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))

    What happens if the same character appears in more than one node? Try, for instance, `Tree.preInTree(List('a', 'b', 'a'), List('b', 'a', 'a'))`.

#### P69 (**) Dotstring representation of binary trees.

We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower-case letters, as in the example of problem P67. Such a tree can be represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which dots (.) are inserted where an empty subtree (`End`) is encountered during the tree traversal. For example, the tree shown in problem P67 is represented as `"abd..e..c.fg..."`. First, try to establish a syntax (BNF or syntax diagrams) and then write two methods, `toDotstring` and `fromDotstring`, which do the conversion in both directions.

    scala> Tree.string2Tree("a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))").toDotstring
    res0: String = abd..e..c.fg...

    scala> Tree.fromDotstring("abd..e..c.fg...")
    res1: Node[Char] = a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))
